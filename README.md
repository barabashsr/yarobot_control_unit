# yarobot_control_unit
ESP32-S3 based servo drive and stepper motor control unit with discrete inputs and outputs, OLED screen for status display/ ESP-IDF framework, RTM DMA peripherals dynamically  assigned to the GPIOs which control active drive (4 simultanuously, up to 10 total), I2C port expander for EN and DIR pins, as well as for  descrete I/O if needed, potentially RS-485 MODBUS RTU communication for reading status from servo and stepper driver units. USB interface with human readable text commands for motor control - position, velocity control interface; position, velocity state interface. Potentialy - closed loop, open loop operation if encoder readings will be implemented (not in MVP stage).
